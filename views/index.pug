        h2 Requests Trap: A tool for capture and display HTTP requests.</h3>
            p
                | This simple tool is useful during the development of apps that
                | integrate with external services, such as http clients, webhooks,
                | etc. The Requests Trap app ('Req App') provides these services with
                |    an endpoint to which they can send requests and notifications.
            p
                | For example, let's assume we are developing an ecommerce site named
                | â€œmyshop" with PayPal integration. During development, Myshop can
                |  use Req App to see PayPal requests via a specific endpoint.
            p
                | If a Req App user gives this URL to the PayPal service:</p>

                li
                    | http://requests-trap.com/fireshop/aerhgewrh/serhsrt
            p
                | Then the user could see the IPN notifications sent by PayPal here:</p>

                li
                    | http://requests-trap.com/fireshop/requests
            p
                | The user can choose any url, all the requests made to that url can
                | be viewed by anyone that knows the url, so he can use hard-to-guess
                | urls to avoid that:

                li
                    | http://requests-trap.com/mysupersecreturlxj34/requests
